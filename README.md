Driver Drowsiness Detection Master
The Driver Drowsiness Detection Master is a real-time system designed to monitor and analyze driver behavior using advanced machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques. The system aims to prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue by providing timely alerts to the driver when signs of drowsiness are detected.

Features
Real-Time Monitoring: Utilizes a dashboard-mounted camera to capture facial features and eye movements continuously.
Drowsiness Detection: Identifies signs of drowsiness such as prolonged eye closure or yawning.
Alerts: Triggers audio or visual alerts to notify the driver when drowsiness is detected.
OpenCV and Python Integration: Processes captured data using OpenCV and Python for high performance and accuracy.
Improved Road Safety: Proactively prevents accidents caused by driver fatigue by ensuring timely interventions.
